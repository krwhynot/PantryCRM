   - Ensure performance within Azure Basic tier limitations

6. User Training and Documentation Validation
   - Test training materials and documentation with actual users
   - Verify users can successfully complete all major tasks
   - Update materials based on user feedback

7. Go-Live Readiness Assessment
   - Conduct comprehensive assessment of system readiness
   - Identify and mitigate any remaining risks
   - Obtain formal approval from stakeholders for production launch

Technical considerations:
- Use structured test plans with clear pass/fail criteria
- Implement automated UI testing where possible
- Use performance testing tools like k6 or JMeter
- Document all test results and issues
- Prioritize issues based on severity and impact
- Implement fixes for critical issues before go-live

# Test Strategy:
1. Test all functionality on multiple device types
2. Verify all user workflows with actual users
3. Test data migration accuracy and completeness
4. Verify performance under load conditions
5. Test training materials and documentation
6. Conduct comprehensive go-live readiness assessment
7. Document all test results and issues
8. Verify all critical issues are resolved before go-live
