# Title: Setup NextCRM Foundation and Project Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with NextCRM foundation, configure Next.js 15 with React 18.2.0, and establish the core project structure with TypeScript configuration.
# Details:
Install Next.js 15.0.3 with React 18.2.0 stable. Configure NextCRM foundation components and resolve any compatibility issues. Setup TypeScript 5.3+ with strict mode, ESLint with Next.js config, and Prettier. Configure package.json with exact versions: next@15.0.3, react@18.2.0, typescript@5.3.0. Setup folder structure: /components, /pages/api, /lib, /types, /styles. Configure next.config.js for bundle optimization targeting <800KB. Install shadcn/ui components and Tremor charts for UI foundation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify NextCRM components load correctly, TypeScript compilation passes without errors, and development server starts successfully. Test bundle analyzer shows initial bundle <200KB baseline.
