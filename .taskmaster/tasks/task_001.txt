# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up NextCRM Foundation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Clone and configure the NextCRM repository with all necessary dependencies, environment variables, and verify the integration of UI components.
# Details:
1. Clone the NextCRM repository from GitHub (pdovhomilja/nextcrm-app)
2. Install all dependencies using npm install
3. Set up environment variables in .env.local including Next.js, Prisma, and Auth.js configurations
4. Enable TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json
5. Verify shadcn/ui integration and ensure all components render correctly with touch optimizations (minimum 44px touch targets)
6. Verify Tremor charts integration and test responsiveness
7. Document the NextCRM architecture including component structure, data flow, and integration points

Technical considerations:
- Use Next.js 14.0.0 or later for best performance and features
- Ensure TypeScript 5.0+ is configured with strict mode enabled
- Verify shadcn/ui v0.4.0+ is properly integrated
- Confirm Tremor v3.0.0+ charts are working correctly
- Document potential modification challenges for food service customization

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful repository clone with all files and branches present
2. Confirm all dependencies install without errors or conflicts
3. Test environment variables by running the development server
4. Verify TypeScript compilation with strict mode enabled
5. Test shadcn/ui components rendering with proper touch targets (minimum 44px)
6. Create sample Tremor charts to verify integration
7. Test responsiveness on different screen sizes including iPad Pro, Air, and Mini in both orientations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Repository Setup and Initialization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure the Git repository for NextCRM Food Service project
### Details:
Initialize Git repository, create .gitignore file, set up branch structure (main, develop, feature branches), create README.md with project overview

## 2. Dependency Management and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up package management and install required dependencies
### Details:
Initialize package.json, install core dependencies (Next.js, React, TypeScript), set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality, configure TypeScript compiler options

## 3. Environment Variables and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up environment-specific configurations and variables
### Details:
Create .env.local file, configure environment variables for development/production, set up next.config.js with environment-specific settings, implement secure handling of sensitive information

Removed internationalization complexity by eliminating next-intl variables from environment configuration and deleting next-intl.config.js file. Updated next.config.js to remove next-intl plugin dependency, streamlining configuration for English-only support. This optimization reduces bundle size and improves performance for the 4-iPad sales team deployment while staying within Azure budget constraints.

## 4. UI Component Integration Verification [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Integrate and verify core UI components for the Food Service CRM
### Details:
Set up a component library (e.g., Material-UI or Tailwind CSS), create basic layout components, implement responsive design, verify component rendering and styling
<info added on 2025-06-03T01:34:00.333Z>
Removed next-intl internationalization system and simplified to English-only implementation. Refactored app directory structure by eliminating [locale] dynamic routing segment and implementing direct routing without internationalization overhead. Fixed all import paths to work with simplified structure. Sign-in screen now functioning correctly with streamlined architecture. Changes reduce complexity and improve performance to meet $18/month Azure budget constraints while preserving iPad optimization for sales representatives.
