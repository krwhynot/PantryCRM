# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up NextCRM Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Clone and configure the NextCRM repository with all necessary dependencies, environment variables, and verify the integration of UI components.
# Details:
1. Clone the NextCRM repository from GitHub (pdovhomilja/nextcrm-app)
2. Install all dependencies using npm install
3. Set up environment variables in .env.local including Next.js, Prisma, and Auth.js configurations
4. Enable TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json
5. Verify shadcn/ui integration and ensure all components render correctly with touch optimizations (minimum 44px touch targets)
6. Verify Tremor charts integration and test responsiveness
7. Document the NextCRM architecture including component structure, data flow, and integration points

Technical considerations:
- Use Next.js 14.0.0 or later for best performance and features
- Ensure TypeScript 5.0+ is configured with strict mode enabled
- Verify shadcn/ui v0.4.0+ is properly integrated
- Confirm Tremor v3.0.0+ charts are working correctly
- Document potential modification challenges for food service customization

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful repository clone with all files and branches present
2. Confirm all dependencies install without errors or conflicts
3. Test environment variables by running the development server
4. Verify TypeScript compilation with strict mode enabled
5. Test shadcn/ui components rendering with proper touch targets (minimum 44px)
6. Create sample Tremor charts to verify integration
7. Test responsiveness on different screen sizes including iPad Pro, Air, and Mini in both orientations
