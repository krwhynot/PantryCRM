**COMPLEXITY:** 9/10 | **DEPENDENCIES:** Phase 3 Complete

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
‚úÖ 100% data migration accuracy with zero data loss
‚úÖ Advanced duplicate detection functional
‚úÖ Relationship integrity maintained
‚úÖ User-guided conflict resolution working

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Robust Excel Parser Service Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive Excel parsing service that supports both .xlsx and .csv file formats with real-time progress indicators and error handling for large datasets
### Details:
Create a service that can handle multiple Excel formats, implement streaming for large files, add progress tracking with WebSocket updates, handle malformed data gracefully, and provide detailed parsing logs and error reports

## 2. Advanced Data Validation and Quality Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Build a robust data validation system using Zod schemas with custom business rules validation and comprehensive quality checks
### Details:
Implement Zod schema validation for all data types, create custom business rule validators, add data quality scoring, implement field-level validation with detailed error messages, and create validation rule configuration interface

## 3. Relationship Preservation and Integrity System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Develop a system to maintain data relationships during migration with foreign key validation and referential integrity checks
### Details:
Create relationship mapping algorithms, implement foreign key constraint validation, build referential integrity checkers, add relationship visualization tools, and create automated relationship repair suggestions

## 4. Enhanced Duplicate Detection and Merge Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Implement sophisticated duplicate detection using fuzzy matching algorithms with user-guided merge workflows and conflict resolution
### Details:
Build fuzzy matching engine with configurable similarity thresholds, create interactive merge interface for user decisions, implement conflict resolution workflows, add duplicate prevention rules, and create merge audit trails
