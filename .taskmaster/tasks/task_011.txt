# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Reporting Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the reporting engine with 4 core report types, including data layer, visualizations, filtering, and export capabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement Report Data Layer with Azure SQL Optimization
   - Create optimized queries for report generation within DTU limits
   - Add caching strategy for expensive aggregations
   - Ensure <10 second report generation requirement

2. Build Weekly Activity Reports by Account Manager
   - Create reports showing interaction volume and type breakdown
   - Include visit frequency, interaction types, and activity summaries
   - Add print-friendly formatting for stakeholder sharing

3. Create Pipeline Status by Principal Reports
   - Build reports showing opportunities by stage and principal
   - Add principal-specific conversion rates and metrics
   - Include stage duration analysis and progression metrics

4. Implement Interaction Volume Analysis Reports
   - Create reports showing time-based interaction trends
   - Add interaction type effectiveness metrics
   - Enable account manager activity comparison

5. Build Organization Performance Tracking Reports
   - Create reports for priority level and segment analysis
   - Add account manager assignment effectiveness metrics
   - Support strategic account management decisions

6. Integrate Tremor Charts for Multi-Device Visualization
   - Implement NextCRM Tremor charts for all report visualizations
   - Ensure charts are touch-friendly and readable
   - Add drill-down and filtering within charts

7. Add Date Range Filtering and Export Capabilities
   - Implement Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Custom range options
   - Provide intuitive date selection interface
   - Create print-optimized layouts for stakeholder presentations

8. Create Report Dashboard with Navigation
   - Build main reporting dashboard with access to all 4 report types
   - Add quick access and summary metrics
   - Ensure dashboard loads quickly with summary data

9. Optimize Report Performance for Azure Basic Tier
   - Ensure all reports generate within 10-second requirement
   - Minimize DTU usage during report generation
   - Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed reports

Technical considerations:
- Use Tremor v3.0+ for chart visualizations
- Implement server-side data aggregation to minimize client processing
- Use React Query/SWR for data fetching with caching
- Consider using PDF.js or similar for export capabilities
- Implement query optimization techniques like materialized views or pre-aggregation
- Use date-fns for date manipulation and formatting

# Test Strategy:
1. Test report generation for all 4 core types
2. Verify report accuracy with test data
3. Test report generation performance (<10 seconds)
4. Verify Tremor charts rendering and responsiveness
5. Test date range filtering functionality
6. Verify export capabilities and formatting
7. Test report dashboard navigation and usability
8. Verify performance with production-scale data volumes
