# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Basic Reporting System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create foundational reporting system with performance dashboards and simple reports targeting <10 second load times.
# Details:
Create reporting API endpoints: GET /api/reports/interactions, GET /api/reports/pipeline, GET /api/reports/performance. Implement SQL query optimization for Azure SQL Basic tier: use appropriate indexes, limit result sets, implement pagination. Create ReportDashboard with Tremor charts: AreaChart for interaction trends, BarChart for pipeline by stage, DonutChart for opportunities by principal. Add date range filtering with react-day-picker. Implement report caching with Redis-compatible Azure Cache (if budget allows) or in-memory caching. Create simple report exports to CSV using papaparse library. Add loading states and error boundaries for report components. Optimize queries to use covering indexes and avoid table scans.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark report load times to ensure <10 seconds for simple reports, test with realistic data volumes, verify chart rendering performance, and validate export functionality.
