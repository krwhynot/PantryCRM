# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Interaction Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the interaction tracking functionality including database schema, API endpoints, forms for 6 interaction types, and timeline views.
# Details:
1. Implement Interaction Database Schema with 6 Types
   - Execute migrations for interaction tracking with relationships
   - Support Email, Call, In Person, Demo/sampled, Quoted price, Follow-up types
   - Ensure proper relationship tracking to organizations/contacts

2. Develop Interaction API Endpoints
   - Create CRUD operations for interaction management
   - Implement type-specific validation and categorization
   - Optimize for frequent interaction logging

3. Create Multi-Device Optimized Interaction Forms
   - Design single-screen forms for each interaction type
   - Optimize for 30-second completion target on both touch and mouse
   - Minimize steps for common interaction recording

4. Implement 6 Food Service Interaction Types
   - Support Email, Call, In Person, Demo/sampled, Quoted price, Follow-up
   - Add type-specific form fields and validation rules
   - Design for future addition of new interaction types

5. Build Auto-complete Functionality
   - Implement predictive text for organization and contact fields
   - Optimize for sub-500ms response time
   - Enable quick selection without extensive typing

6. Add Auto-save and Form Recovery
   - Implement periodic saving to prevent data loss
   - Add form recovery after browser interruption
   - Provide visual feedback for save status

7. Create Interaction History and Timeline Views
   - Build comprehensive interaction history displays
   - Add filtering and search within interaction history
   - Enable interaction pattern analysis

Technical considerations:
- Use React Hook Form for efficient form handling
- Implement localStorage/IndexedDB for form recovery
- Use optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Consider using React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implement debounced auto-save functionality
- Use date-fns for date manipulation and formatting

# Test Strategy:
1. Test interaction CRUD operations for all 6 types
2. Verify relationship integrity with organizations and contacts
3. Test 30-second completion target on both touch and mouse
4. Verify auto-complete performance with large datasets
5. Test auto-save and form recovery functionality
6. Verify interaction history and timeline views
7. Test performance with large interaction volumes
8. Verify multi-device usability for interaction workflows

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design interaction data model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a TypeScript-compliant data model for the six interaction types, considering food service industry specifics
### Details:
Define interfaces for each interaction type (e.g., call, meeting, email, task, note, custom). Include fields for priority levels (A-D), market segments, distributors, contact roles, and sales pipeline stage. Ensure compatibility with Azure SQL Database schema.

## 2. Develop optimized interaction forms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create responsive forms for each interaction type with iPad-friendly 44px touch targets
### Details:
Implement forms using NextCRM foundation components. Optimize for performance by lazy-loading form elements. Include validation for TypeScript strict mode compliance. Ensure forms are accessible and easy to use on iPads.

## 3. Implement interaction timeline component [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a performant timeline component to display all interaction types
### Details:
Develop a reusable timeline component that efficiently renders different interaction types. Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets. Optimize for Azure SQL Database queries, replacing MongoDB-specific operations.

## 4. Create interaction analytics dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.3
### Description: Develop a dashboard for analyzing interaction data specific to the food service industry [Updated: 6/2/2025]
### Details:
Design and implement charts and graphs for visualizing interaction trends, priority levels, market segments, and sales pipeline progression. Ensure responsive design for iPad compatibility.
<info added on 2025-06-03T01:42:39.173Z>
Define and implement 6 specific interaction types within the visualization system: Email, Call, In Person, Demo/sampled, Quoted price, and Follow-up. Each interaction type should have distinct visual representations in charts and graphs, with appropriate color coding and filtering capabilities to allow users to analyze trends by interaction type.

## 5. Optimize database queries and migrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Refactor database queries for Azure SQL and create migration scripts from MongoDB
### Details:
Optimize SQL queries for interaction data retrieval and storage. Develop migration scripts to transfer existing MongoDB data to Azure SQL Database, ensuring data integrity and performance in the new schema.
