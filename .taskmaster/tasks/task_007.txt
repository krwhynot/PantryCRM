# Task ID: 7
# Title: ðŸ“ž Enhanced Interaction Tracking [CRITICAL]
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: critical
# Description: Implement 6-type interaction tracking system (Email, Call, In Person, Demo/sampled, Quoted price, Follow-up) with optimized quick entry forms targeting 30-second data entry and auto-complete functionality.
# Details:
**6 INTERACTION TYPES FOR FOOD SERVICE:**
Email | Call | In Person | Demo/sampled | Quoted price | Follow-up

**PERFORMANCE TARGETS:**
- Quick entry forms: 30-second target per interaction

- Batch operations with error handling

**COMPLEXITY:** 7/10 | **DEPENDENCIES:** Tasks 5, 6

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
âœ… All 6 interaction types fully functional
âœ… 30-second entry time achieved consistently
âœ… Auto-complete responds under 500ms
âœ… Error boundaries protect interaction logging
âœ… Touch-optimized forms for iPad entry

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Interaction Database Schema with 6 Types and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive database schema supporting 6 distinct interaction types with optimized indexing, partitioning strategies, and query performance tuning for high-volume logging operations.
### Details:
Create normalized tables for interaction types, implement proper indexing for frequent queries, set up database partitioning for timeline data, and establish performance benchmarks for concurrent write operations.

## 2. High-Performance Interaction API Endpoints with Type-Specific Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints with type-specific validation rules, bulk operations support, and optimized response times for each of the 6 interaction types with comprehensive error handling.
### Details:
Implement CRUD operations for each interaction type, create validation schemas, add bulk insert/update capabilities, implement rate limiting, and ensure sub-100ms response times for standard operations.

## 3. Optimized Quick Entry Forms Targeting 30-Second Entry Time [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Build responsive form interfaces optimized for rapid data entry with smart defaults, keyboard shortcuts, and streamlined workflows to achieve 30-second average completion time across all interaction types.
### Details:
Design mobile-first forms with progressive enhancement, implement keyboard navigation, add smart field pre-population, create form templates, and conduct user testing to validate 30-second target.

## 4. Auto-Complete and Auto-Save with Performance and Conflict Resolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement intelligent auto-complete functionality and robust auto-save mechanisms with conflict resolution, offline support, and optimized performance to prevent data loss and enhance user experience.
### Details:
Build predictive text for common fields, implement debounced auto-save with local storage backup, create conflict resolution UI for concurrent edits, add offline queue management, and ensure seamless sync when connectivity resumes.
