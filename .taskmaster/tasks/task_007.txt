# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Authentication and Role-Based Access Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Setup NextCRM integrated authentication system with role-based access control for sales representatives, managers, and administrators.
# Details:
Configure NextCRM auth system with NextAuth.js 4.24+. Setup User model with roles: sales_rep, manager, admin. Implement role-based middleware for API routes using NextAuth getServerSession(). Create login/logout pages with shadcn/ui components. Setup session management with JWT tokens, 24-hour expiration. Implement role-based UI rendering with useSession hook. Create ProtectedRoute component for client-side protection. Add password requirements: min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number. Configure RBAC: sales_rep (CRUD own data), manager (read all, CRUD own team), admin (full access). Use bcrypt for password hashing with 12 rounds.

# Test Strategy:
Test login/logout flow, verify role-based API access restrictions, validate session persistence, test password requirements, and confirm UI elements show/hide based on roles.
