# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Settings Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the settings management system for 9 categories including database schema, API endpoints, admin interface, and dynamic dropdowns.
# Details:
1. Implement Settings Database Schema for 9 Categories
   - Execute migrations for SettingCategory and SettingOption tables
   - Support Priority, Segment, Distributor, Account Manager, Stage, Position, Reason, Source, Interaction categories
   - Design for dynamic value addition and modification

2. Develop Settings API Endpoints
   - Create CRUD operations for settings management
   - Implement validation for settings changes
   - Add settings cache invalidation

3. Create Settings Management Admin Interface
   - Build admin interface for managing all 9 setting categories
   - Provide intuitive interface for each category type
   - Add clear indication of system vs. user-defined settings

4. Implement Dynamic Dropdowns Throughout Application
   - Replace static enums with dynamic settings-driven dropdowns
   - Ensure real-time updates when settings change
   - Optimize dropdown population and caching

5. Add Color Coding Support for Priority and Status
   - Implement color coding for priority levels and status indicators
   - Ensure color contrast compliance and alternative indicators
   - Allow administrators to modify color schemes

6. Create Settings Cache and Context Provider
   - Implement React context for settings with caching
   - Optimize settings retrieval and minimize API calls
   - Provide easy-to-use hooks for settings access

7. Implement System Protection and Data Validation
   - Prevent deletion of core system settings
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Validate setting changes against business rules

8. Create Default Settings Data for Food Service
   - Populate initial settings data for all 9 categories
   - Include industry-standard values for food service
   - Support import of existing Excel dropdown values

Technical considerations:
- Use React Context API for global settings state
- Implement SWR/React Query for settings data fetching and caching
- Use React Hook Form for settings management forms
- Consider using Zod for schema validation
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience

# Test Strategy:
1. Test settings CRUD operations for all 9 categories
2. Verify dynamic dropdown updates throughout application
3. Test color coding support and customization
4. Verify settings cache performance and invalidation
5. Test system protection for core settings
6. Verify default settings data for food service
7. Test import of existing Excel dropdown values
8. Verify multi-device usability for settings management
