# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Performance-Optimized Search and Auto-Complete
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced search functionality with auto-complete for organizations and contacts, optimized for sub-second response times.
# Details:
Create search API endpoints: GET /api/search/organizations, GET /api/search/contacts with query parameters. Implement SQL Server full-text search with CONTAINS() and FREETEXT() functions. Add database indexes on searchable fields: organizations.name, contacts.first_name, contacts.last_name. Create SearchCombobox component with debounced input (300ms), virtual scrolling for large results. Implement client-side caching with React Query 5.0+ for search results (5-minute TTL). Add search highlighting with match emphasis. Create global search component for header navigation. Optimize queries to return only essential fields for auto-complete. Add search analytics tracking for query optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark search performance with 1000+ records to ensure <1 second response, test auto-complete with various input patterns, verify caching behavior, and validate search result accuracy.
