# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Contact Management with Role Hierarchy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create contact management system with multiple contacts per organization, food service-specific roles, and primary contact designation.
# Details:
Create Contact model: organization_id FK, first_name, last_name, email, phone, role (FK to Settings), is_primary boolean, notes. Implement API endpoints: GET /api/contacts (by organization), POST/PUT/DELETE /api/contacts/[id]. Build ContactForm with role selection from Settings (Executive Chef, Buyer, Manager, Owner, Kitchen Manager). Implement primary contact logic - only one primary per organization, auto-update when new primary selected. Create ContactList component with role-based filtering and quick contact switching. Use React Hook Form with Zod validation: z.object({ first_name: z.string().min(1), last_name: z.string().min(1), email: z.string().email().optional(), role: z.string(), is_primary: z.boolean() }). Add contact hierarchy display in organization view.

# Test Strategy:
Test contact CRUD operations, verify primary contact constraints, validate role-based filtering, confirm contact hierarchy display, and test quick contact switching functionality.
