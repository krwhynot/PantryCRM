# Task ID: 3
# Title: ðŸš¨ Critical Dependency Fixes [BLOCKING - HIGH PRIORITY]
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: critical
# Description: Resolve critical blocking issues identified in audit: React Beautiful DnD incompatibility, bundle size optimization (40% reduction needed), AWS SDK architectural mismatch, and React 19 stability assessment for production readiness.
# Details:
**CRITICAL AUDIT FINDINGS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:**
- React Beautiful DnD incompatible with React 19 RC (blocking production)
- Bundle size 40% too large affecting performance (<800KB target)
- AWS SDK architectural mismatch in Azure-focused system
- Missing React 19 compatibility validation

**COMPLEXITY:** 8/10 | **TIMELINE:** Week 1 | **DEPENDENCIES:** Task 1

**PERFORMANCE IMPACT:**
- 40% bundle size reduction (moment.js â†’ date-fns)
- React 19 compatibility enabling production deployment
- Architectural alignment with Azure services
- Touch device drag-and-drop functionality restoration

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
âœ… @hello-pangea/dnd replaces react-beautiful-dnd completely
âœ… Bundle size verified under 800KB target
âœ… All AWS SDK references replaced with Azure equivalents
âœ… React 19 compatibility confirmed across all components

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. React Beautiful DnD Replacement with @hello-pangea/dnd [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace react-beautiful-dnd with @hello-pangea/dnd to ensure React 19 compatibility. Update all drag-and-drop components, test functionality, and ensure smooth user interactions across the application.
### Details:
Install @hello-pangea/dnd, update import statements, modify component implementations, test drag-and-drop features in kanban boards, lists, and other interactive elements. Verify performance and accessibility compliance.

## 2. Bundle Size Optimization - Replace moment.js with date-fns [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Replace moment.js with date-fns and remove unused dependencies to achieve 40% bundle size reduction. Audit current dependencies and optimize imports for better performance.
### Details:
Analyze current bundle size, replace moment.js usage with date-fns equivalents, remove unused packages, implement tree-shaking optimizations, and validate date/time functionality across all components.

## 3. AWS SDK Replacement with Azure Equivalents [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Replace AWS SDK implementations with Azure equivalents for architectural alignment. Update cloud service integrations, storage solutions, and authentication mechanisms.
### Details:
Map AWS services to Azure equivalents, update SDK imports and configurations, modify authentication flows, test cloud storage operations, and ensure seamless migration of existing cloud functionalities.

## 4. React 19 Stability Assessment and Compatibility Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Conduct comprehensive React 19 compatibility assessment, validate all components and dependencies, and ensure application stability with the new React version.
### Details:
Test all React components with React 19, validate hooks usage, check for deprecated patterns, run comprehensive test suite, perform performance benchmarking, and document any breaking changes or required updates.
