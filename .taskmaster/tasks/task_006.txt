# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Rapid Interaction Logging System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core interaction logging system optimized for 30-second entry with six interaction types and mobile-friendly interface.
# Details:
Create Interaction model: type (Email, Call, In Person, Demo/sampled, Quoted price, Follow-up), organization_id FK, contact_id FK, date, notes, created_by. Implement API endpoints with optimized queries: POST /api/interactions, GET /api/interactions (by organization/contact). Build InteractionForm with large touch targets (44px minimum), auto-complete organization/contact selection, pre-populated fields. Use React Hook Form with optimized re-renders, implement auto-save every 10 seconds. Create mobile-optimized layout with Tremor components, minimize form fields for speed. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users. Implement client-side caching for recent organizations/contacts. Use Zod validation: z.object({ type: z.enum(['Email', 'Call', 'In Person', 'Demo/sampled', 'Quoted price', 'Follow-up']), organization_id: z.number(), contact_id: z.number().optional(), notes: z.string() }).

# Test Strategy:
Time interaction entry to ensure <30 seconds, test on touch devices with 44px targets, verify auto-save functionality, validate form performance on mobile networks, and test auto-complete speed.
