âœ… Role hierarchy properly implemented
âœ… Primary contact business logic functional
âœ… Duplicate prevention with fuzzy matching
âœ… N+1 query prevention implemented

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Contact Database Schema with Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement optimized database schema for contact management with role hierarchy, primary contact designation, and food service role integration. Include performance indexes, relationship mappings, and data validation constraints.
### Details:
Create tables for contacts, roles, role_hierarchies, and contact_roles with proper foreign key relationships. Implement indexes for frequently queried fields (name, email, phone, role_type). Design primary contact designation logic with unique constraints. Add food service specific role types (chef, server, manager, supplier) with hierarchy levels. Include audit fields and soft delete functionality.

## 2. Contact API Endpoints with N+1 Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints for contact operations with strategic eager loading, relationship includes, and query optimization to prevent N+1 problems. Implement role-based access control and bulk operations.
### Details:
Create CRUD endpoints with strategic includes for roles and hierarchies. Implement bulk contact import/export with validation. Add role assignment endpoints with hierarchy validation. Include pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed contact data and role hierarchies.

## 3. Contact Management Interface with Memoization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Build responsive contact management interface with role-based filtering, memoized components, and optimized rendering for large contact lists. Include primary contact designation UI and role hierarchy visualization.
### Details:
Develop contact list with virtual scrolling and memoized row components. Create role hierarchy tree view with drag-drop functionality. Implement primary contact toggle with visual indicators. Add advanced filtering by role, department, and hierarchy level. Include contact merge interface and bulk action capabilities.

## 4. Contact Search and Duplicate Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement intelligent contact search with fuzzy matching algorithms and automated duplicate detection system. Include merge suggestions, similarity scoring, and food service role-specific matching criteria.
### Details:
Develop fuzzy search using Levenshtein distance and phonetic matching for names, emails, and phone numbers. Implement duplicate detection algorithms with configurable similarity thresholds. Create merge suggestion interface with field-by-field comparison. Add food service role-specific matching (e.g., supplier company names, chef certifications). Include automated duplicate prevention on contact creation.
