# Task ID: 10
# Title: Build Visual Pipeline Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create interactive pipeline dashboard with drag-and-drop functionality and visual opportunity management across all stages.
# Details:
Install @dnd-kit/core 6.1+ and @dnd-kit/sortable for drag-and-drop functionality. Create PipelineDashboard component with 5 columns for each stage. Implement OpportunityCard component with key details: organization name, principal, estimated value, probability. Add drag-and-drop between stages with optimistic updates and API sync. Create pipeline filters: by principal, by sales rep, by date range. Implement real-time updates using SWR or React Query for data synchronization. Add pipeline metrics: total value per stage, conversion rates, average time in stage. Use Tremor charts for pipeline analytics visualization. Implement responsive design for tablet/mobile viewing.

# Test Strategy:
Test drag-and-drop functionality across all stages, verify optimistic updates and API synchronization, validate pipeline metrics calculations, and test responsive behavior on different screen sizes.
