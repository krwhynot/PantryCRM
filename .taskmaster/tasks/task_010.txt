# Task ID: 10
# Title: Bundle Size Optimization
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application bundle size to meet 800KB target.
# Details:
Analyze current bundle size and implement optimizations to reduce it below 800KB. Use code splitting, tree shaking, and other techniques to minimize bundle size.

# Test Strategy:
Measure bundle size after each optimization. Verify application functionality is not affected by optimizations. Test loading performance on slow connections.
