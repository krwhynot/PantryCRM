# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Search and Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the global search system and implement email/password authentication with user management.
# Details:
1. Build Global Search System
   - Implement search across organizations, contacts, and interactions
   - Add search suggestions and intelligent filtering
   - Optimize for sub-second search response

2. Optimize Search Performance for Azure SQL Basic
   - Implement proper indexing and query optimization
   - Add search result caching where appropriate
   - Design for growth in data volume

3. Set Up Simple Email/Password Authentication
   - Configure Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js) with email/password login
   - Implement password requirements and session security
   - Avoid Azure AD to optimize costs

4. Create Basic User Management
   - Implement basic user creation and management
   - Add user authentication workflows
   - Create simplified access model (all users have same access)

5. Implement Session Management and Security
   - Configure secure session handling
   - Add session persistence and timeout behavior
   - Implement proper logout and session cleanup

Technical considerations:
- Use Auth.js v4.0+ for authentication
- Implement proper password hashing with bcrypt
- Use Prisma for user data storage
- Consider using JWT for stateless authentication
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use React Query/SWR for search caching
- Consider using Algolia or Meilisearch for advanced search capabilities if needed

# Test Strategy:
1. Test global search with various query types and filters
2. Verify search performance with large datasets
3. Test authentication flows for email/password login
4. Verify user management functionality
5. Test session persistence and timeout behavior
6. Verify security measures including CSRF protection
7. Test search result relevance and accuracy
8. Verify sub-second search response requirement
