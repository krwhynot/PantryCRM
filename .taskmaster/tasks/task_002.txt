# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Azure SQL Database and Prisma ORM
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Setup Azure SQL Database Basic tier and configure Prisma ORM with the complete database schema for organizations, contacts, interactions, opportunities, and settings.
# Details:
Provision Azure SQL Database Basic ($5/month, 2GB, 5 DTU). Install Prisma 5.7+ with @prisma/client and prisma CLI. Create schema.prisma with all required models: Organizations (priority_id, segment_id, distributor_id), Contacts (organization_id FK, role, is_primary), Interactions (6 types, organization_id FK, contact_id FK), Opportunities (11 principals, 5 stages), Settings (category, key, label, color, sort_order, active). Configure connection string with SSL. Run prisma migrate dev to create initial migration. Setup Prisma generate in build process.

# Test Strategy:
Verify database connection, run test queries for each model, confirm foreign key constraints work correctly, and validate Prisma Client generation. Test connection pooling under load.
