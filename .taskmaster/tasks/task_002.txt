# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Azure Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Azure infrastructure including SQL Database, App Service, firewall rules, authentication, backup strategy, and cost monitoring.
# Details:
1. Create Azure SQL Database (Basic tier, $5/month)
   - Provision through Azure Portal with 2GB storage cap
   - Document DTU limits and performance characteristics

2. Create Azure App Service (Basic B1 tier, $13/month)
   - Configure for Node.js 18 LTS runtime
   - Set up deployment slots for staging/production

3. Configure Azure Firewall Rules
   - Set up appropriate IP restrictions for development and production
   - Implement least privilege principle for access control

4. Set Up Database Authentication
   - Configure SQL authentication with strong credentials
   - Securely store connection strings in App Service configuration

5. Configure Backup Strategy
   - Set up automated daily backups with 7-day retention
   - Test and document point-in-time restore procedures

6. Setup Cost Monitoring
   - Configure Azure Cost Management with $18/month budget
   - Set up alerts at 70% ($12.60) and 90% ($16.20) thresholds
   - Create dashboard for daily cost tracking

Technical considerations:
- Use Azure SQL Basic tier with DTU-based purchasing model
- Configure connection pooling to optimize DTU usage
- Implement Azure App Service auto-scaling rules within B1 tier limits
- Use Azure Key Vault for secure credential storage

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Azure SQL Database creation and accessibility
2. Test connection string from local development environment
3. Confirm Azure App Service provisioning and Node.js runtime configuration
4. Verify firewall rules by testing connectivity from development environments
5. Test database authentication and connection security
6. Perform test backup and restore to verify disaster recovery procedures
7. Verify cost monitoring dashboard and alert configurations
8. Confirm total projected monthly cost is exactly $18.00
