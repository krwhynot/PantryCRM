# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance mobile experience with touch-optimized interfaces, improved performance, and mobile-specific navigation patterns.
# Details:
Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px). Create mobile navigation with hamburger menu using shadcn/ui Sheet component. Optimize touch targets to minimum 44px with adequate spacing. Implement swipe gestures for common actions using react-use-gesture. Add mobile-specific form layouts with larger inputs and simplified workflows. Create bottom navigation for primary actions on mobile. Implement virtual scrolling for large lists using react-window. Add haptic feedback for touch interactions where supported. Optimize images with next/image for mobile bandwidth. Create mobile-first interaction logging with voice-to-text support using Web Speech API.

# Test Strategy:
Test on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome), verify touch target sizes, validate swipe gestures, test form usability with on-screen keyboards, and measure performance on 3G networks.
