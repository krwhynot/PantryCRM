# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Excel Data Migration Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Excel data migration pipeline including parsing, validation, relationship preservation, and verification.
# Details:
1. Analyze Current Excel Data Structure
   - Document current Excel workbook structure and relationships
   - Create mapping strategy from Excel to CRM schema
   - Assess data quality issues and cleanup requirements

2. Create Excel Parser Service for .xlsx and .csv
   - Build robust parsing for Excel files with error handling
   - Support both .xlsx and .csv formats
   - Provide comprehensive error reporting and recovery

3. Implement Data Validation and Quality Checks
   - Create validation rules for all entity types and relationships
   - Add food service industry-specific validation
   - Identify and flag potential data quality issues

4. Build Relationship Preservation and Account Manager Migration
   - Maintain organization-contact-interaction-opportunity relationships
   - Preserve existing account manager assignments accurately
   - Test with complex relationship scenarios

5. Create Import Progress Tracking and Preview System
   - Implement real-time progress indicators and import preview
   - Provide clear feedback and error reporting
   - Enable preview of import results before final commitment

6. Implement Duplicate Detection and Conflict Resolution
   - Prevent duplicate organizations and contacts during import
   - Add fuzzy matching algorithms and conflict resolution
   - Provide merge options for similar records

7. Create Migration Verification and Audit System
   - Verify completeness and accuracy of migrated data
   - Track all import activities with detailed logging
   - Implement rollback capabilities for failed imports

8. Execute Historical Data Migration with Validation
   - Perform complete migration of all historical data
   - Verify data integrity and completeness
   - Document migration process and results

Technical considerations:
- Use ExcelJS or SheetJS for Excel file parsing
- Implement streaming parser for large files
- Use Zod or Joi for data validation
- Implement transaction-based imports for atomicity
- Consider using worker threads for performance
- Use fuzzy matching libraries like Fuse.js for duplicate detection

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Excel parsing with actual Excel files from current system
2. Verify data validation rules and error reporting
3. Test relationship preservation with complex data scenarios
4. Verify account manager assignment preservation
5. Test duplicate detection and conflict resolution
6. Verify import progress tracking and preview functionality
7. Test migration verification and audit system
8. Verify rollback capabilities for failed imports
