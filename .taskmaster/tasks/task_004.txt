# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Organization Management with Search
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive organization management with CRUD operations, industry-specific fields, and optimized search functionality with auto-complete.
# Details:
Create Organization model with fields: name, address, phone, email, priority_id, segment_id, distributor_id (all FKs to Settings). Implement API endpoints: GET /api/organizations (with search, pagination), POST/PUT/DELETE /api/organizations/[id]. Build search with SQL Server CONTAINS() for full-text search, targeting <1 second response. Create OrganizationForm with shadcn/ui components: Input, Select (populated from Settings), Textarea. Implement auto-complete using Combobox component with debounced search (300ms). Add validation with Zod: z.object({ name: z.string().min(1), priority_id: z.number(), segment_id: z.number(), distributor_id: z.number() }). Create OrganizationList with pagination, sorting, and filtering.

# Test Strategy:
Test CRUD operations, verify search performance <1 second with 1000+ records, validate auto-complete functionality, confirm dropdown population from Settings, and test form validation edge cases.
