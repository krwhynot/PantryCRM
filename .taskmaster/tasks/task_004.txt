# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Multi-Device UI Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a responsive UI framework optimized for both touch and mouse input, with special focus on iPad compatibility.
# Details:
1. Research Multi-Device UI Best Practices
   - Document iPad-specific design requirements
   - Research touch target size requirements (minimum 44px)
   - Investigate Safari-specific considerations for iPad

2. Configure Responsive Design System
   - Set up breakpoints for iPad Pro (12.9"), iPad Air (10.9"), iPad Mini (8.3")
   - Optimize for landscape primary usage while supporting portrait
   - Implement fluid layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox

3. Customize shadcn/ui Components
   - Modify NextCRM components to ensure 44px minimum touch targets
   - Apply food service branding color scheme (A=Green, B=Yellow, C=Orange, D=Red)
   - Enhance form components for touch input optimization

4. Setup Testing Environment
   - Configure development server for iPad testing
   - Set up browser DevTools for device simulation
   - Implement responsive testing utilities

5. Create Component Documentation
   - Document iPad-optimized component usage
   - Create guidelines for developers on touch-friendly UI patterns
   - Document responsive design principles and breakpoints

Technical considerations:
- Use TailwindCSS for responsive design with custom breakpoints
- Implement React context for device type detection
- Use CSS variables for theming and color scheme
- Consider using Framer Motion for touch-friendly animations
- Implement focus states that work well for both touch and keyboard navigation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test all interactive elements to verify 44px minimum touch targets
2. Verify responsive design on iPad Pro, Air, and Mini in both orientations
3. Test with both touch and mouse input to ensure consistent functionality
4. Verify color contrast meets WCAG standards for accessibility
5. Test loading times and performance on 3G connections
6. Verify browser compatibility across Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define UI Framework Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the core architecture for the responsive UI framework, considering NextCRM foundation and TypeScript strict mode requirements.
### Details:
Create a modular structure, define coding standards, and set up the development environment with TypeScript strict mode. Ensure compatibility with NextCRM's existing codebase.

## 2. Develop Core Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Design and implement core UI components with customization options, focusing on food service industry specifics.
### Details:
Create reusable components for priority system (A-D levels), market segments, distributor management, contact roles, and the 5-stage sales pipeline. Ensure components are customizable and follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines.

## 3. Implement Responsive Layout System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create a flexible layout system that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
### Details:
Develop a grid system and responsive utilities. Implement media queries and flexible units (e.g., rem, vh, vw) to ensure proper scaling across devices.

## 4. Optimize for iPad and Touch Devices [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Enhance the UI framework for optimal performance on iPads and other touch devices.
### Details:
Implement 44px touch targets for improved usability. Create touch-friendly interactions and gestures. Optimize layout and components for tablet viewports.

## 5. Integrate with Azure SQL Database [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Migrate data models and queries from MongoDB to Azure SQL Database.
### Details:
Analyze existing MongoDB schema and create corresponding SQL schema. Develop data access layer compatible with Azure SQL. Update API endpoints to use the new database.

## 6. Perform Testing and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of the UI framework across various devices and optimize performance.
### Details:
Perform unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Optimize rendering performance, reduce bundle size, and implement lazy loading where appropriate. Conduct user acceptance testing with food service industry professionals.
