# Dependency Updates Log

## 2025-06-05 - Task 3.1: React Beautiful DnD Replacement

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Dependencies**:
   - `react-beautiful-dnd` (v13.1.1) - Deprecated
   - `@types/react-beautiful-dnd` (v13.1.8) - No longer needed

2. **Added Dependencies**:
   - `@hello-pangea/dnd` (latest) - Maintained fork with React 18+ support

### Code Impact

- No active usage of drag-and-drop functionality was found in the codebase
- Backend support for kanban boards exists but is not currently used in the frontend
- All references to the old library have been removed

### Implementation Notes for Future Development

When implementing drag-and-drop features (e.g., kanban boards, sortable lists):

1. **Basic Setup**:
   ```tsx
   import { DragDropContext, Droppable, Draggable } from '@hello-pangea/dnd';
   ```

2. **Best Practices**:
   - Use `Droppable` and `Draggable` components for list items
   - Implement proper `onDragEnd` handler for reordering logic
   - Use `useCallback` for performance optimization
   - Add proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Use `React.memo` for draggable items
   - Implement virtualization for large lists
   - Consider using `shouldRespectForceTouch={false}` for better touch support

### Testing

When writing tests for drag-and-drop components:

1. Test drag start, drag over, and drop behaviors
2. Verify state updates after reordering
3. Test edge cases (empty lists, single item lists, etc.)
4. Include keyboard navigation tests for accessibility
