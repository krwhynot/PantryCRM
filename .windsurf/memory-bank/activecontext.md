# 🛍️ Active Context — Food Service CRM Development

## 📊 Current Session Objective

**🌟 Goal:** Finalize Windsurf rule files and establish readiness for Phase 1 implementation of the Food Service CRM
**🧹 Focus:** Structured project setup, implementation clarity, and full alignment with business requirements
**🚦 Status:** Pre-Phase 1 stage — the architectural blueprint is fully validated and approved; groundwork is being laid for a robust launch

---

## 📊 Implementation Progress

### ✅ Completed Documentation Milestones

The foundational documents that define and shape the scope of this project are fully complete:

* **📄 Implementation Plan:** A detailed 23-page document outlining the entire 8-week schedule, broken down by weekly goals and tasks
* **🧱 Architecture Blueprint:** Comprehensive technical stack visualization including database layers, front-end frameworks, deployment pipelines, and cloud infrastructure
* **🔍 Review Workflow:** A multi-stage quality assurance pipeline with stakeholder feedback loops and iteration gates
* **🚧 Feature Implementation Workflow:** Modular, feature-sliced structure enabling isolated development and independent deployment of CRM features
* **🗞 Product Requirements Document (PRD):** Fully defined user stories, use cases, data models, and backend service expectations

---

### ⚙️ In-Progress — Windsurf Rule Files

Currently working on finalizing the 5 critical Windsurf configuration and standards files:

* ✅ `.windsurfrules` — Establishes the base project ruleset for the workspace
* ✅ `coding-standards.md` — Standardizes code with food service-specific naming and logic conventions
* ✅ `deployment.md` — Documents Azure App Service deployment pipeline
* ✅ `productContext.md` — Architecture and platform constraints
* ✅ `activeContext.md` — Session tracker for goals, activities, and decisions

## 📀 Code + Data Patterns

### 🧹 Adapted Component Logic

```tsx
export function PriorityBadge({ priorityId }: { priorityId: number }) {
  const { priorities } = useSettings();
  const priority = priorities.find(p => p.id === priorityId);
  return (
    <Badge className="text-white min-h-11" style={{ backgroundColor: priority?.colorCode }}>
      {priority?.displayText}
    </Badge>
  );
}
```

### 🗄️ Prisma Schema Example

```prisma
model Organization {
  id         Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name       String @unique @db.NVarChar(255)
  priorityId Int    @map("priority_id")

  priority   SettingOption @relation("OrganizationPriority", fields: [priorityId], references: [id])
}
```
