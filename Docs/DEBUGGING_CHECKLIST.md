## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Component Integration
- [ ] Import NextCRM components in main layout
- [ ] Test components with actual data
- [ ] Verify responsive design on iPad
- [ ] Check 44px touch target compliance

### Build Process
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify no compilation errors
- [ ] Check bundle size with `npm run analyze:simple`
- [ ] Optimize dependencies with `npm run optimize`
- [ ] Verify no console errors during runtime

### Database Connection
- [ ] Update `.env.local` with actual Azure SQL credentials
- [ ] Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply schema
- [ ] Test database queries for performance
- [ ] Verify connection pooling is working

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test page load times (target: <1s desktop, <2s iPad)
- [ ] Verify search performance (target: <300ms response)
- [ ] Check memory usage in browser
- [ ] Test with throttled network conditions

## Quality Gates

### Phase 1: Core Components
- [ ] All NextCRM components render without errors
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode passes with no errors
- [ ] Components meet 44px touch target requirement
- [ ] Light/dark mode works correctly

### Phase 2: Data Integration
- [ ] Azure SQL connection established
- [ ] CRUD operations work for all entities
- [ ] Search functionality returns correct results
- [ ] Data validation works correctly

### Phase 3: Performance
- [ ] Bundle size under 800KB target
- [ ] Page load under 1 second on desktop
- [ ] Search results appear in under 300ms
- [ ] No layout shifts during interaction

### Phase 4: User Experience
- [ ] iPad compatibility verified
- [ ] All 11 food service brands represented
- [ ] 5-stage sales pipeline implemented
- [ ] Settings management system working

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Missing Component Imports
**Problem**: `Cannot find module '@/components/nextcrm'`
**Solution**: Ensure the path alias is correctly configured in tsconfig.json:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Bundle Size Issues
**Problem**: Bundle exceeds 800KB target
**Solution**: 
- Check `npm run analyze:simple` output for large dependencies
- Replace moment.js with date-fns
- Use dynamic imports for large components
- Implement proper code splitting

### 3. Database Connection Errors
**Problem**: Cannot connect to Azure SQL
**Solution**:
- Verify firewall rules in Azure Portal
- Check connection string format
- Ensure proper credentials in `.env.local`
- Test connection with Azure Data Studio

### 4. Build Failures
**Problem**: Next.js build fails
**Solution**:
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify all required dependencies are installed
- Check for circular dependencies
- Ensure all required environment variables are set

## Final Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create production environment file
cp .env.local .env.production
```

### 2. Dependency Optimization
```bash
# Deduplicate and prune dependencies
npm run optimize
```

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build
```

### 4. Azure Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Azure App Service
az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group <resource-group> --name <app-name> --src ./build.zip
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Functionality Check
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify data persistence
- [ ] Check all critical user flows

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Azure Application Insights
- [ ] Configure performance alerts
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Track user engagement metrics

### 3. Security Verification
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Check authentication security
- [ ] Verify API endpoint protection
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is encrypted
