## 💰 Azure Cost Optimization Strategy

### Monthly Cost Breakdown
| Service | Tier | Monthly Cost | Justification |
|---------|------|--------------|---------------|
| Azure SQL Database | Basic | $5.00 | 2GB storage, sufficient for 4 concurrent users |
| Azure App Service | Basic B1 | $13.00 | 1.75GB RAM, custom domain support |
| **Total** | | **$18.00** | Under $20 budget requirement |

### Cost Optimization Decisions
- ✅ **Azure SQL Basic** instead of Standard (sufficient for 4 users)
- ✅ **App Service Basic B1** instead of Standard (adequate for NextCRM)
- ✅ **No Redis required** (in-memory caching sufficient for small scale)
- ✅ **Single region deployment** (no geo-redundancy needed)
- ✅ **Azure SQL 7-day backup** (built-in, no additional costs)

### Scaling Strategy
- Current architecture supports 100+ users without changes
- Monitor usage and upgrade tiers only when needed
- Leverage Azure free tiers wherever possible
- Regular cost review and optimization opportunities
