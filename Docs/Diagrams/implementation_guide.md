## 🔧 Technical Implementation Priorities

### Database Optimization Strategy
```sql
-- Critical Indexes for Performance
CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_search ON organizations(name, priority_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_org_search ON contacts(organization_id, first_name, last_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_interactions_date ON interactions(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_opportunities_stage ON opportunities(stage_id, probability);
```

### React Component Architecture
```typescript
// Component Hierarchy Priority
1. Layout/Navigation (NextCRM foundation)
2. Dashboard with quick actions
3. OrganizationList with filtering
4. InteractionQuickEntry form
5. ContactDetail with relationship data
6. ReportDashboard with <10s generation
```
